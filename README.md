# StockDetails

StockDetails is a sample application to list down stock details of some organizations.

## Getting startted

- Clone the application from `https://github.com/jayampathiw/stock-details`
- Navigate to stock-details folder by entering `cd stock-details`.
- Install the dependencies by entering `npm i`or `npm install`.
- Start the application by entering `ng serve` or `npm start` or `npm run start`.
- Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Special Notes and Considerations

- As per the discussion we had on 16th July 2021, I have mocked the API data instead of calling the Yahoo financial.
- Error handling is not considered during the implementation of the project.
